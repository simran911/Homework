    "An Exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle runtime errors and other exceptional conditions that may arise during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected happens.\n",
    "They are raised when the interpreter detects an error during execution, such as division by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or trying to access a variable that hasn't been defined.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, TypeError, etc.\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled using try and except blocks to gracefully deal with errors.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "Syntax errors occur during the parsing of code (before execution) when the Python interpreter encounters incorrect syntax in the code.\n",
    "They are caused by mistakes in the code's structure, such as missing colons, unmatched parentheses, misspelled keywords, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed at all, as the interpreter cannot understand the code.\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include forgetting to close parentheses, misspelling variable names, using invalid operators, etc."
